# Setting up GoMS

You can setup goms on any machine/server of your choice.

## Native binary

GoMS is written in golang which gives us a native binary for almost all systems. You can fetch the lastest binary from the releases


## Docker

A docker image is also available which can be deployed on any docker compatible host
